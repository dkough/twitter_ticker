-Work in progress-

The end goal of this project is to make stock market predictions based on Tweets.  It is a learning excersise inspired by studies such as this https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405918817300247 . 

The first upload is a case study of Royal Carribean International which was particularly hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The cruise line industry was featured prominently in news and social media, which makes it great to use for this project.  The code runs based on 3 inputs at the beginning of the notebook, plug in whatever ticker you wish and have fun!
