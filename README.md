# twitter_ticker

-Work in progress-

The end goal of this project is to make stock market predictions based on Tweets.  It is a learning excersise inspired by papers written about the subject such as the study by  Tahir M. Nisar and Man Yeung, found here https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405918817300247 . 

The first upload is a case study of Royal Carribean, $RCL, which was particularly hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The cruise line industry was also featured prominently in news and social media.  It begins on the first day of 2020 and ends in mid June.  The code is reusable, and runs based on 3 inputs at the beginning of the notebook.
